![Mapset Verifier](https://i.imgur.com/O4d2jTa.png)

Mapset Verifier (MV) is a desktop app which tests quantifyable issues in [beatmapsets](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmaps) from [osu!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!), such as unsnapped objects and unused files. Many of these issues would otherwise disqualify the map from being [ranked](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#ranked). Although mainly aimed at [Beatmap Nominators](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmap%20Nominators), this can also be used by mapset creators and reviewers to speed up [the ranking process](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

MV is a successor to the game's built-in [AiMod](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/AiMod) and [Sieg's Modding Assistant](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/359381), providing more features and greater scalability. Some examples include auto-updates, plugin support, and integrated documentation and diff utilities.

*This is currently being ported to osu!lazer. [You can track its progress here!](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues/12091#issuecomment-878760791)*

### Note
Some issues are not easily quantified, especially ones related to [metadata](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#metadata) and [timing](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#timing); far from everything is covered. Also, [false positives and false negatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives) may occur, as with any similar tool. So always use your own judgement and be critical about what the program points out, especially warnings.

## Common Problems

- **Windows protected pc**
    - Solution: More info > Run anyway *OR* Right click installer > Properties > Unblock
    - Reason: Installer has no signed certificate (costs)

- **Stuck on install screen when reinstalling**
    - Solution: Uninstall before reinstalling
    - Reason: Limitation in electron-builder

- **Javascript error ENOENT, no MapsetVerifierBackend.exe in `/app/api/win-x64`**
    - Solution: Uninstall, reinstall, then whitelist this exe in your antivirus before running again
    - Reason: Antivirus false positive, deletes the backend (part that does checks) on first run

## Examples of fixed false positives/negatives
### Modding Assistant
- counting extended break times as drain time.
- failing to account for minimum SV (0.1x).
- misinterpreting hit sounds on slider bodies as hit sounds on heads/tails.
- completely ignoring storyboard variables and animation frames.

### AiMod
- incorrectly detecting unsnaps on slider tails < 2 ms off
- not accounting for stacking.
- using a vastly outdated star rating system, saying you need an easy/normal when you already have one.
- using inaccurate playfield measurements to detect offscreen hit objects.

## Plugins

Add check DLLs to `%APPDATA%/Mapset Verifier Externals/checks` to have them load in just like the default checks. To create these DLLs, have a look at how [MapsetChecks](https://github.com/Naxesss/MapsetChecks) was created. [This](https://github.com/rorre/MV-SliderOnly#building) is probably also useful.

Third-party plugins (that I'm aware of):
- [CatchCheck](https://github.com/rorre/CatchCheck) by [-Keitaro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3378391), adds osu!catch-specific checks.
- [MapsetChecksCatch](https://github.com/Darius-Wattimena/MapsetChecksCatch) by [Greaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2369776), adds osu!catch-specific checks.
- [MVTaikoChecks](https://github.com/Hiviexd/MVTaikoChecks) by [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976), adds osu!taiko-specific checks.

In general, do be careful about which check plugins you use, as they can be malicious. The plugins are executed by the back end of the application, so they can pretty much do anything the rest of the application can.

## Technical Overview

The backend is written in [C#/.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), with a simple [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) server. The frontend is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop application written in HTML, CSS, and [JS/JQuery](https://jquery.com/). The server-client communication is done with [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr). Upon selecting a mapset, the frontend requests tabs to be rendered, and the backend returns HTML.
